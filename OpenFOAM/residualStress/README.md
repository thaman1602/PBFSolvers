# Background
The folder contains input scripts that are required to create Powder bed using Discrete Element Method. DEM is a meshless numerical method to calculate powder particles intereaction in granular media. Opensource LIGGGHTS package is used to simulate the powder bed.

# Packages to install
**Libraries:** LIGGGHTS

# How to run
in.trial is the DEM script that contains all the necessary LIGGGHTS commands to create the Powder bed. Upon successful execution, the location file provides the powder particle data required by the thermofluid model.

The emulator can be excuted using following command:
```console
liggghts < in.trial
```

# Whom to contact?
The DEM scripts were developed as part of Gowthaman Parivendhan's PhD project. This work is supervised by Prof Alojz and Prof Philip Cardiff
